Hello! I am currently a junior majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Beijing University of Technology [https://www.bjut.edu.cn/]. My research interests include multimodal large language models, embodied intelligence, and AI for Security applications in these areas. I am actively seeking MPhil and PhD opportunities for Fall 2026. I would be very grateful for the opportunity to further discuss my background and research, so please feel free to contact me at my primary email: mstaryc02@gmail.com or at my less frequently used institutional email: wangyc2002@emails.bjut.edu.cn.


科研经历
======
In 2024, I had the honor of participating in research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as a remote research assistant. During this period, my primary responsibilities included reading research papers, conducting literature reviews, and integrating various existing methodologies. At the recently concluded 25th ICCV, we submitted a paper titled “Exploring Typographic Visual Prompts Injection Threats in Cross-Modality Generation Models.” For this project, I was mainly responsible for implementing and comparing ideas for various open-source and closed-source models through coding, while also preparing, analyzing, and annotating the figures and tables in the paper.



标化成绩与在校经历
======
Over the course of three academic years (with one semester's results still pending), I have maintained an average score of 87.79 and a GPA of 3.6/4.0, ranking within the top 15%–20% of my class. I was fortunate to receive the university-level Excellence in Academics Scholarship at Beijing University of Technology twice (in 2022 and 2024). In my theoretical courses, I achieved commendable results in subjects such as Advanced Mathematics (99), Deep Learning (97), Analog Electronics (92), and Complex Analysis (92). Additionally, my keen interest in natural language experiments has led me to perform well in practical courses, including Fundamentals of Machine Learning Experiment (99), Comprehensive Natural Language Processing Experiment (97), Comprehensive Big Data Processing Experiment (95), and Electronics Experiment (92).

Meanwhile, in both my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I have actively participated in various activities to further enhance my skills:

In 2022, I worked with an on-campus mentor to complete the project titled "Personalized Product Recommendation System Based on Deep Learning."

In 2022, I participated in and successfully completed Beijing University of Technology's Outstanding Student Program.

In 2023, I took part in the "User Growth Prediction Challenge" organized by Datawhale, where I achieved first prize.

In 2023, I participated in Datawhale's summer camp and was recognized as an outstanding participant.
