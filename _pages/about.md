Hello! I am currently a junior majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Beijing University of Technology [https://www.bjut.edu.cn/]. My research interests include multimodal large language models, embodied intelligence, and AI for Security applications in these areas. I am actively seeking MPhil and PhD opportunities for Fall 2026. I would be very grateful for the opportunity to further discuss my background and research, so please feel free to contact me at my primary email: mstaryc02@gmail.com or at my less frequently used institutional email: wangyc2002@emails.bjut.edu.cn.



标化成绩与在校经历
======
Over the course of three academic years (with one semester's results still pending), I have maintained an average score of 87.79 and a GPA of 3.6/4.0, ranking within the top 15%–20% of my class. I was fortunate to receive the university-level Excellence in Academics Scholarship at Beijing University of Technology twice (in 2022 and 2024). In my theoretical courses, I achieved commendable results in subjects such as Advanced Mathematics (99), Deep Learning (97), Analog Electronics (92), and Complex Analysis (92). Additionally, my keen interest in natural language experiments has led me to perform well in practical courses, including Fundamentals of Machine Learning Experiment (99), Comprehensive Natural Language Processing Experiment (97), Comprehensive Big Data Processing Experiment (95), and Electronics Experiment (92).

Meanwhile, in both my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I have actively participated in various activities to further enhance my skills:

In 2022, I worked with an on-campus mentor to complete the project titled "Personalized Product Recommendation System Based on Deep Learning."

In 2022, I participated in and successfully completed Beijing University of Technology's Outstanding Student Program.

In 2023, I took part in the "User Growth Prediction Challenge" organized by Datawhale, where I achieved first prize.

In 2023, I participated in Datawhale's summer camp and was recognized as an outstanding participant.


在校经历
======
1. 22-23 星火计划
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
