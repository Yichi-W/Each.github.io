This is the certificate I received upon completing the 32nd “Spark Fund” project at Beijing University of Technology, titled “Personalized Product Recommendation System Based on Deep Learning.” The project primarily focused on the application and implementation of deep learning in personalized recommendation systems, successfully achieving its predetermined objectives.
